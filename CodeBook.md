The tidy dataset contains the mean of several measurements per activity and subject 
(30 subjects were evaluated).

The types of activities that the subjects were carrying out at the time of measurement
are the following: 

LAYING
SITTING
STANDING
WALKING
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
WALKING_UPSTAIRS

Every row contains the mean of all the observations per type of measurement, grouped by 
activity and subject. The measurements whose means were calculated are the following:
